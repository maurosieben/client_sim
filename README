To run the script you need to pass the number of clients you desire to simulate: 

   usage: 

   python client-gen.py X

The clients will be created getting the ID's on id.csv. The limit of clients which can be created is the number of lines on the file. 

To kill all clients just publish the following message: 
   
   mosquitto_pub -h "192.168.0.100" -t "lights" -m "kill"
